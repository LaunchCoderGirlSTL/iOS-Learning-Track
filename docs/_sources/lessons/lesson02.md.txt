Once you feel like you have a good grip on Swift data types and optionals, attempt the quiz in Canvas.

## In-class Work
We will be working on expanding our knowledge of Swift. The assignment will require us to use a lot of UI features as well, which we will be talking about in class.

## Assignments
Complete the [Simple Tic-Tac-Toe](../../assignments/simple-tic-tac-toe.html) assignment and submit it on Canvas.
