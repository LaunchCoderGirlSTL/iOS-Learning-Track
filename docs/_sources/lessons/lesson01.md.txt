# Lesson 1: Introduction to Swift 4 and XCode

## Learning Objectives

* Understand the basic types in Swift, how to define and manipulate them
* Know what a Xcode/Swift Playground is and be able to use it. Learn when it would be used in day-to-day work
* Understand a basic history of Swift and iOS as a technology

## Prep Work

Install XCode and download the book on Swift below before coming to class. The current version of Xcode is 9.4. This is what we'll be using in class. This version requires High Sierra operating system. If for some reason your mac does not support this OS, please let us know.

When you have completed the install, upload to Canvas a screenshot of the dialog found by going to *Xcode > About Xcode*.

We walk through some of the setup steps in this video:

## In-class Work

We will be getting to know each other and starting to learn more about Swift.

## Assignment

Read up to the beginning of the Collection Types section in the Swift Programming Language book linked below. Understand the reading through doing the experiments in the book and just trying out different things in the Xcode playground once it has been installed.
