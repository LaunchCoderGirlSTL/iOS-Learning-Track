Swift Persistence Assignment
============================

Objectives
----------
This assignment will be to enhance an already working app. The design for enhancements is totally up to you - add features how you think they're best added.

Requirements
------------
Enhance the example from class with the following features:

#. Display the available user profiles to choose from in a UITableView
#. Instead of hard coded user1 and user2, create an "Add user" button that will add to the available list of user profiles

  - Example of design choice: you could either have a hard-coded "guest" user with an "Add" button, or introduce an onboarding page that asks the user to create their username
  - What will you do if the added user already is taken?

#. Display the current user on the note taking page
#. Add an additional feature of your choice

Ideas
-----

- Add settings for the text color or other font attributes
- Add the ability to delete a user (make sure to clean up their persisted data!)
