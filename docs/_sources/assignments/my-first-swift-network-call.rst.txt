My First Swift Network Call
===========================

Objectives
----------

The class shows how to do a simple "GET" HTTP call in Swift. Use a public API to fetch, parse, and display data on a device/simulator. You will have to use the documentation the public API provides to figure out the URL to pass into the URLSession. It must:

   - Include a table view with dynamic cells

   - Include a segue to a new view controller

   - Make two network calls (not restricting to GET calls, but that's what was taught)

   - Display the parsed data from both calls

   - Use Autolayout

Hint: Don't forget to add the property to the info.plist to "Allow arbitrary loads" - brownie points if you find out how to allow just the domain you use.

A `list <https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis>`_ of public APIs (try to stick to ones that list "NO" under the Auth column, if it says API key, reach out and we can help you with that one too):

Here's a `link <https://youtu.be/O0VMl7obvH0>`_ to the class video, which you may find useful to reference.
