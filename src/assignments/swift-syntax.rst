Objectives
----------

   - Become familiar with using tableView delegates and dataSources

   - Understand how to create a segue to another storyboard by using a storyboardReference

   - Know how to transition to another storyboard using a storyboard segue in code, and pass data to the storyboard's view controller


Requirements
------------

   - Create a project that has a tableview with at least 5 cells (but only one prototype cell!)

   - These cells should be flashcard-esque, in that they will prompt the user to think of some common Swift Syntax

   - A user should be able to tap on a cell, which will transition to another view controller where the answer will be displayed


Hints
-----

   - Remember to create a Struct with the "question" and "answer" as variables, which will be passed via the segue.

   - Don't forget to embed your main view controller in a NavigationViewController

   - Don't forget to add a cellIdentifier and segueIdentifier to the prototype cell on the table view, and the segue, respectively

   - Think of ways to make your code easier to read by using MARKS, and putting code you can group together in extensions, like this:


      - //MARK: - tableView dataSource

      extension UIViewController: tableViewDataSource {

         ...

      }
