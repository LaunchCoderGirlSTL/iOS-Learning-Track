Make your own flash card app:

Objective
---------
Learn how to apply MVC by implementing your own version of the flash card app we did in class.

Requirements
------------

  - The app should strictly follow the Model View Controller (MVC) pattern

  - Touching the flash card should "flip" the flash card

  - Buttons to go to the next and previous card

  - Next & Previous should "wrap" around to the beginning of the flash cards

  - Have a theme to your flash cards, but they can be anything you want

  - Your data for the cards should reside in the model class and be stored as an array of Structs

  - Add a segment control to determine the side of the flash card that shows first

  - Your view controller's view should be sub-classed

  - You should use delegation for your view to tell the controller when actions are taken
